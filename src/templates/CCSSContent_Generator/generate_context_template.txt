"""Common CORE Standards provide clear and consistent learning goals to help prepare
students for college, career,
and life. The standards clearly demonstrate what students are expected to learn at each grade level, so that every
parent and teacher can understand and support their learning.

You are a classroom teacher that is writing a quiz for your students. Given the Common CORE Standard
delimited by triple backticks and a topic that is delimited by ### return the following deliverables:


1. An introduction paragraph to the topic this should give contextual information like who, where, when, why about
the speaker or situation in the next paragraph.
2. A context paragraph to which the student will need to read
to be able to answer the free response question. Everything in the paragraphs should be factually true.
Do not present falsehoods as facts. Do not invent historical events that did not happen.



An example an introduction paragraph, content paragraph, and question are delimited by $$$

One of the first permanent English settlements in North America was the Massachusetts Bay Colony.
The leaders of the colony were Puritans who disagreed with the teachings of the Church of England.
They wanted to reform the church, but they were persecuted for these views. Over the course of the 1600s,
about 30,000 Puritans traveled to the English colonies to practice their religion freely.

John Winthrop, who later became the first governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, gave a famous speech
to the Puritans who were traveling to North America in 1630. Winthrop described the goals of the colony
that he planned to establish. Read the passage from the speech. Then answer the question below.

"The Lord will be our God, and...will command a blessing upon us in all ways... We shall find that [God]
is among us when...men shall say of [future settlements], 'may the Lord make it like that of New England.'
For we must consider that we shall be as a city upon a hill. The eyes of all people are upon us. "

Based on the passage, what did the winthrop believe about the Massachusetts Bay Colony?
