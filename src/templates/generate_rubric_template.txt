 Use the following procedure:
 1. Create a json dictionary that has the same keys and hierarchy as the example
 2. What is the "Standard" given in the Common Core data? Place this in the json dictionary
 3. What is the Description given in the Common Core data? Place this in the json dictionary
 4. What is the Skill given in the Common Core data? Place this in the json dictionary
 5. What is the Grade given in the Common Core data? Place this in the json dictionary

 6. What is the "Description" and "Skill" for this Common CORE?
 7. Use the information gathered in step three to generate Definitions for a student that "Doesn't meet standard",
 "Partially meets standard", "Meets or exceeds standard"
 8. Place the definitions you wrote in step 4 in the json dictionary you created in step 1

 9. Reread the text provided in STUDENT READING
 10. Reread the text provided in STUDENT QUESTION
 11. Use the values in Common CORE to determine what "Grade" this standard is intended for.
 12. Imagine you are a student in the grade you identified in step 11 that has read the text you summered in step 9
 and is now answering the question from step 10. Write a response to the question that  completes the
 "Meets or exceeds standard" definition you wrote in step 7.
 13. Place the text you wrote in the previous step into the json dictionary you created in step 1

 14. Reread the text provided in STUDENT READING
 15. Reread the text provided in STUDENT QUESTION
 16. Use the values in Common CORE to determine what "Grade" this standard is intended for.
 17. Imagine you are a student in the grade you identified in step 16 that has read the text you summered in step 14
 and is now answering the question from step 16. Write a response to the question that  completes the
 "Partially meets standard" definition you wrote in step 7.
 18. Is this text significantly worse than the text you wrote in step 12?
 19. If yes, continue, if no return to step 14. If the answer is no you CANNOT move on to the next step. YOU MUST
 RETURN TO STEP 14 and try again. Don't give up, you will get it on the next try.
 20. Place the text you wrote in step 17 into the json dictionary you created in step 1

 21. Reread the text provided in STUDENT READING
 22. Reread the text provided in STUDENT QUESTION
 23. Use the values in Common CORE to determine what "Grade" this standard is intended for.
 24. Imagine you are a student in the grade you identified in step 23 that has read the text you summered in step 21
 and is now answering the question from step 22. Write a response to the question that  completes the
 "Doesn't meet standard" definition you wrote in step 7.
 25. Is this text significantly worse than the text you wrote in step 16?
 26. If yes, continue, if no return to step 21. If the answer is no you CANNOT move on to the next step. YOU MUST
 RETURN TO STEP 21. Don't give up, you will get it on the next try.
 27. Place the text you wrote into the json dictionary you created in step 1

 28. In the json dictionary insert Values using the following logic:
 The Value for "Meets or exceeds standard" == 1
 The Value for "Partially meets standard" == 0.5
 The Value for "Doesn't meet standard" == 0

Congratulations you finished the task, output the json dictionary you created in the procedure
and the logic reasoning you did while executing the procedure.
Do not forget to output your results for every step in the procedure.
