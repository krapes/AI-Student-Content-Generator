{'student_reading': "Animal Habitat Exploration\n\nOne way to learn about animals is to explore their habitats. A habitat is the natural environment where an animal lives and finds everything it needs to survive, such as food, water, shelter, and space. Animals have specific adaptations that help them thrive in their habitats. For example, some animals have long legs to help them walk or run on land, while others have webbed feet to help them swim in water. By exploring different habitats, we can learn more about the animals that live there and how they have adapted to their environment.\n\nNow let's explore the topic of animal habitats in more detail. Read the passage below and then answer the question that follows.\n\n'The Amazon rainforest is one of the most diverse habitats in the world.
